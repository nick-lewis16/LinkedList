# LinkedList
In this code, I create a Linked List implementing basic functionality.
This consists of 2 classes:
 - Node which will have instance variables data and next;
 - LinkedList which will have instance variables first, last, and len.

With functions:
 - Append
 - Prepend
 - Insert
 - Magic methods for length and boolean comparison between lists
 - Magic methods for user-friendly and machine-readable printing
